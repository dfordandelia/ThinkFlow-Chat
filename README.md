# Intent-Based ChatBot using Neural Networks
This Python script creates an intent-based chatbot using a neural network for natural language understanding and response generation. The chatbot uses a trained model to classify user input into predefined intent categories and provide appropriate responses. The code also includes data preprocessing, model training, and saving the trained model for future use.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
PyTorch
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Ensure you have the following files in the same directory as the script:

intents.json: A JSON file containing predefined intents and their associated patterns and responses.
model.py: A Python file defining the neural network model (myNeuralNet) used for training and prediction.
nltk_utils.py: A Python file containing utility functions for tokenization and bag-of-words representation.

# Usage
Run the script
1.The chatbot will greet you and prompt you for input. Type your message and press Enter.

2.The chatbot will process your input, classify it into a relevant intent, and provide a suitable response based on the trained model's predictions.

3.To exit the chat, simply type quit and press Enter.

# Important Files
intents.json: Contains predefined intents, patterns, and responses. Customize this file to define the behavior of your chatbot.

model.py: Defines the neural network architecture (myNeuralNet) for intent classification.

nltk_utils.py: Contains utility functions for tokenization and bag-of-words conversion.


# Note
Note
The script first preprocesses the training data and trains a neural network model using the provided intents and patterns.

The trained model is saved to a file named chatbot_data.pth.

The chatbot uses a probability threshold (default: 0.8) to determine whether a response is appropriate based on the model's confidence in its classification.

The code demonstrates a simplified example of intent-based chatbot functionality. Further enhancements can be made to improve the bot's accuracy, robustness, and usability.

Remember that this is a basic implementation. For a more advanced chatbot, you may need to consider more complex language models and additional features.

Feel free to modify, expand, and refine the code to better suit your specific use case and requirements.
